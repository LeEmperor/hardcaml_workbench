# Workbench documentation

Workbench is a project control and inspection application: operate independent
Hardcaml projects, observe execution, and inspect identified hardware evidence.
Project/provider commands remain useful without the application.

The feature list is the concise product inventory; feature sets group delivery
themes (FS0 and adopted-evidence FS1 delivered; substantial FS2 accepted and closed;
FS5's first appearance slice delivered).
F01–F12 feature documents record architectural behavior and boundaries; the WB
catalog owns proposed feature scope, estimates and dependencies. The construction
plan alone owns activated implementation order and delivery checklist. Ticket
acceptance criteria describe a future completion gate, not an active implementation
checklist. Focused acceptance records linked there own exact runtime
evidence. A feature request or a provider capability is not proof
of an implemented Workbench feature.

## Current orientation — 2026-10-17

- **FS0 Demos A–C delivered with bounded limitations:** typed execution boundary,
  tile host/palette, project-scoped tests/logs, named workspaces, linked/independent
  contexts, run pins, public ASIC synthesis and autosaved-session/L2 reopening.
  Existing Dune, RTL/artifact/provenance and hierarchy workflows remain exercised.
- Real serial balanced/synth_delay synthesis completed with **673/685 cells**,
  acceptance **`not_evaluated`**, early allocation and client-detach survival.
  Actual cached UI reopening shows **673→685** and **pinned 673 beside following
  685**. [The plan](construction_phase_plan.md#evidence-and-candidate-baseline)
  consolidates evidence roots and exact candidate executable/hash provenance.
- **D1 accepted:** windows are attached surfaces; Overview/Timing/Resources are
  workspaces. Their selectors control a shared Main run context by default, with
  explicit independence/relink and per-tile references. See [F10](features/run_contexts.md).
- [F09 simulation/tests](features/simulation_and_tests.md) retain generic Dune tests
  and add structured FS2 suites/cases/seeds, live outcomes, targeted reruns, bounded
  history and exact trace export over the existing supervisor. Real Cyclesim and
  native HTTP/PTY acceptance passed. The owner accepted the basic demo and authorized
  milestone closure; [controls and evidence](fs2_acceptance.md),
  [followups](backlog/fs2_followups.md), and
  [integration handoff](fs2_acceptance.md#integration-handoff).
- **D2/D3 FS0 defaults accepted:** captured/revalidated targets, no missing-flow
  fallback, ordinary launch does not select, guarded launch-and-view, follow/pin-run
  first. Immutable snapshots/archival retention and richer command policy are later.
- Tiles render asynchronously delivered module state. The daemon shares/caches
  provider queries; rendering does not spawn one provider process per tile.
- [F11 run-summary caching](features/run_summary_cache.md) is delivered in L1/L2;
  canonical evidence remains provider-owned. Fixture warm/restart report calls stay
  2→2; real restart preserves exact evidence identity with `Cached_unverified`.
- [F12 appearance](features/appearance.md) keeps themes/components/layouts separate,
  utility chrome mountable and headers configurable. FS5/V1's first A–E skins and
  independent color/icon/density controls are delivered; richer gallery fixtures,
  reusable tabs and final aesthetic review remain pending. No embedded editor is selected.
- Limits: shelf layout rather than freeform geometry; domain refresh is polled and
  the endpoint/assignment form remains basic. Local input redraw is immediate.
  Embedded graphical editing and unsupported source mappings remain later work.
  Broader frontend race/reconnect/cancellation coverage and scaling measurements
  remain explicit followups.
- FS3's [first adoption slice](fs3_adoption.md) delivers existing-project initialization,
  CLI template export/import/clone and persistent client appearance/header choices.
- FS1 now includes [synthesis metrics and aggregate physical evidence](fs1_acceptance.md),
  signed timing, check verdicts, verified declared clocks and exact finalization
  import. Real six-stage execution, external acceptance and owned-container
  cancellation have separate retained evidence. The final [FS1 investigation](fs1_investigation.md)
  delivers path/corner/group navigation, measured clock evidence and stage-specific
  physical/routing/congestion tables. FS2 project-scoped structured simulation is
  now delivered independently of ASIC configuration.
- Workbench-owned finalization/acceptance and report/artifact text viewing are
  delivered, with real palette/transport detach, cancellation, idempotency and
  restart checks. External text opening uses a private terminal-host export,
  not the daemon's original path. Exact binary handoff is also delivered, with
  a real exported GDS loaded headlessly by KLayout; interactive GUI rendering and
  embedded editing are not claimed by that test.
- Parent format/lint, full runtest/build, installed workflow, actual metrics/physical
  HTTP/PTY/L2 checks, original synthesis inspection and the five-mode interrupt
  matrix passed. Evidence and limitations are recorded in the active plan.
- **Owner usability confirmation:** Escape now works well in the timing-inspection
  workflow. This closes the reported latency followup. Timing's concise summary/
  detail/provenance split is also delivered; clearer inspector breadcrumbs,
  contextual help and a Close inspector command remain
  [usability polish](backlog/README.md#inspector-usability-polish). FS2's independent
   delivery and acceptance are recorded separately above.

- FS3 post-merge integration and native icons/activity are delivered; see
  [FS3 integration](fs3_integration_plan.md) and
  [native indicator evidence](terminal_indicators_plan.md). Preset identity,
  atomic defaults and selected persistent presentation choices are foundations,
  not outstanding catalog tasks.
- [WB-009](features/evidence/WB-009-timing-coherency.md) is now owner-verified/closed:
  the actual a023 wrong-stage defect was fixed, and after read-only historical triage
  the owner confirmed recent fixes resolve the older report. Its original exact
  execution identity remains unasserted; no new physical flow was used for diagnosis.

Build, launch and check commands are in the repository [README](../README.md).
