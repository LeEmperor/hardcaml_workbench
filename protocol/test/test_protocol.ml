(** Checks on the shared protocol schemas.

    These cover the representation rules the architecture states, rather than the shape of
    any particular value: an unavailable metric must not read as a measurement, completion
    must not read as closure, and a dirty working tree must not read as an exact source
    identity. The round-trip checks exist because the schemas are derived for both sexp
    and bin_io before the transport is chosen, and a schema that serialized only one way
    would not be noticed until then. *)
