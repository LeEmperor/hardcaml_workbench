(** Synchronous byte-bounded reads of local regular evidence files, called off the
    Async scheduler. Opens nonblocking before inspecting the descriptor, rejecting
    FIFOs/devices without waiting for a peer, then reads only that same descriptor.
    This local-filesystem interface does not provide a wall-clock deadline for
    stalled remote filesystem operations; those require process-isolated IO. *)
